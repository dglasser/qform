<h4>INSTALLING QUERYFORM</h4>
To install or run QueryForm, you must first have the Java Runtime Environment, 
version 1.3 or later, installed on your computer. If you do not already have it,
it is freely available and can be dowloaded at 
<a href='http://java.sun.com' target='_blank'>http://java.sun.com</a>.
<p>
If you are installing QueryForm on a Windows PC, the easiest method is to use the
automated installation program.* The automated installation program is packaged in a jar
file named "qform-N.N-installer.jar", where "N.N" is the number of the version 
you are installing. The installation program can be downloaded from 
<a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71893' target='_blank'>
QueryForm's download page</a>.
<p>
To run the installer program, first try double-clicking on its icon in the folder
where it was downloaded. If your system is configured so that files with a ".jar" extension
are associated with the Java virtual machine, the installer program should launch. If it doesn't,
open a Command Prompt window (DOS shell), change to the directory where the qform-N.N-installer.jar 
is located, and run this command (making the appropriate substitution for "N.N"):
<p><pre>
    java -jar qform-N.N-installer.jar
</pre><p>	
Once the installation program has completed, you can run QueryForm by double-clicking
its shortcut. If you chose not to create a shortcut during installation, you
can run it by launching the file qform.bat, which will be located in the directory
in which you installed QueryForm.
<p>
<strong>NOTE: </strong>The automated installation program will run on non-Windows platforms,
however, no shortcut or launch script will be created. It is nonetheless a convenient way to install
QueryForm along with all of it's required libraries.
<p> 
<strong>Manual Installation:</strong> To install QueryForm manually, you will need the file
qform.jar, which is packaged inside qform-N.N-bin.zip ("N.N" is the version number) and is available 
<a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71893' target='_blank'>
here</a>. You will also need the required library jar files, which are available
<a href='http://qform.sourceforge.net/downloads/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
The libraries required to run 
QueryForm are listed in the file REQUIRED_LIBRARIES.TXT, which is 
distributed with QueryForm. If you don't have a copy, you can get it 
<a href='http://qform.sourceforge.net/downloads/REQUIRED_LIBRARIES.TXT' target='_blank'>here</a>.
<p>
The qform.jar file must be in your Java classpath, and the library jars
should be in the same directory as qform.jar. As long as the library jars are
in the same directory as qform.jar, they should not need to be in your Java classpath,
because they are referenced in qform.jar's manifest file with the "Class-Path" header.
<p>
Within the directory where the qform.jar file is, create a subdirectory 
called "drivers". Place any jar or zip files containing JDBC drivers into 
that directory, and they will be loaded when the program is started.
<p>
If you're not familiar with what a Java classpath is, don't worry; simply arrange
the qform.jar file, the libary jars and the drivers directory as described above,
and try one of the launching methods described below. One of them should work.
<p>
<a name='running' href='#top'>top</a>
<h4>RUNNING QUERYFORM</h4>
<p>
As previously mentioned, if you have installed QueryForm with the automated installation
program on a Windows PC, you can run the program simply by double-clicking the
shortcut created by the install program. If you installed QueryForm manually, or
on a non-Windows computer, or are experiencing problems with the shortcut or the 
supplied qform.bat file, this section explains how to launch the program from a command 
line or script.
<p>
If you have arranged qform.jar, the library jars, the drivers directory 
and any needed JDBC driver files (.jar or .zip) as described above, you can 
start QueryForm simply by executing the followng command from a command prompt, 
in the same directory where qform.jar is located:
<p>
<pre>
    java -jar qform.jar
</pre>
<p>	
If you want QueryForm to use JDBC drivers that are already in your system 
classpath, use this command line on a Windows system:
<p>
<pre>
    java -classpath qform.jar;%CLASSPATH% org.glasser.qform.QForm
</pre>
<p>	
and this command on Unix systems:
<p>
<pre>
    java -classpath qform.jar:$CLASSPATH org.glasser.qform.QForm
</pre>
<p>	
If qform.jar and all needed JDBC drivers are in your system classpath, and 
the library jars are in the same directory as qform.jar, you can run the 
program with this command:
<p>
<pre>
    java org.glasser.qform.QForm
</pre>
If you are running QueryForm against a DB2 database (particularly one on a 
mainframe) and the program terminates abnormally, try starting it with 
this command line switch:
<p>
<pre>
    java -Dno.foreign.keys=true org.glasser.qform.QForm
</pre>
<p>    
Configuration information for QueryForm is stored in an XML file called 
qform.xml which normally resides in the user's home directory. If one is 
not found when the program is launched, it will be created. Alternate 
configuration files can be specified as a command line argument:
<p>
<pre>
    java org.glasser.qform.QForm S:/share/project/qform-share.xml
</pre>
<p>    
or by using the -D switch to set the "qform.config" system property:
<p>
<pre>
    java -Dqform.config=/etc/qform/config.xml org.glasser.qform.QForm
</pre>
<p>      
The order of priority for specifying a configuration file is:

<ol>
         <li> First the presence of a command line argument is checked for.
    </li><li> Second, the presence of the "qform.config" system property is checked for.
    </li><li> Third, the presence of a file "qform.xml" in the user's home directory is checked for.
    </li><li> The configuration file is created in the user's home directory.
    </li>
</ol>
        
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Passwords that are saved in the configuration file between sessions 
are stored in clear text. If this creates a security problem, do not save 
passwords; enter them into the login dialog each time you connect to the 
database.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The configuration file is not locked while the program is running, 
and it is overwritten each time the program is exited normally. If you are 
sharing a configuration file with other users on a network, you may set 
its filesystem attributes to read-only to prevent individual users from 
modifying the configuration file. If QueryForm is unable to overwrite a 
configuration file, it will simply alert the user and then exit normally.

<h4>CONFIGURING A DATA SOURCE</h4>

Eventually, there will (hopefully) be detailed documentation for 
configuring a data source through QueryForm's data source dialog. For the 
moment, however, this program will be most useful to Java developers who 
are already familiar with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and who are 
familiar with concepts such as driver classes and URLs. If you fall into this
category, the data source dialog should be self-explanatory.
<p>
For those who are not, but are familiar with ODBC data sources, here are 
brief instructions for connecting QueryForm to an ODBC data source that 
has already been configured on your computer:

<ol>

 <li>From the Connect menu, select Data Source...

 <li>In the dialog that appears, click the New button to make the fields 
editable. Then make the following entries:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Display Name</strong> - This is any descriptive name that you choose for this 
data source, for example, "Test Database".

</li><li><strong>Driver Class</strong> - Select sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver from the dropdown list 
of available drivers.

</li><li><strong>Database URL</strong> - type in the following:
   <pre>
   jdbc:odbc:&lt;ODBC Data Source Name&gt;
   </pre>
   
and substitute the name of the ODBC data source for 
&lt;ODBC Data Source Name&gt;.

</li><li><strong>Requires Login</strong> - Check this box if a username/password combination must be 
sent to the database when a connection is made.

</li><li><strong>User Name</strong> - This should be a user name that can be used to connect to the 
ODBC data source indicated in the Database URL field.

</li><li><strong>Password</strong> - This is the password that can be used in combination with the 
given user name. It can be stored here for convenience, however it will be 
saved in the configuration file in CLEAR TEXT. You may leave this field 
blank, and a login dialog will be presented to you when you attempt to 
connect.

</li><li><strong>Max Connections</strong> - QueryForm pools connections, and will not use a 
connection for other purposes while there is an open resultset associated 
with it. An open resultset is a large one, of more than 500 records, that 
have not all yet been read from the database. You can tell that a 
resultset is open when the status bar message says something like "Row 45 
of 750 read". If an entire resultset has been read, the status message 
will say something like "Row 53 of 97". The absence of the word "read" 
means that the entire resultset has been read from the database and the 
connection has been made available again in the pool. If you don't expect 
to have many large resultsets open simultaneously, then a small number, 
such as 3 should suffice. Otherwise use a larger number.

</li><li><strong>Login Timeout</strong> - This is the number of seconds after which, if a successful 
connection is not established, QueryForm should abort the attempt. This 
value should usually be set to between 15 and 30 seconds.

</li></ul>

Once all of the entries have been made, click the Save button. Then click 
Connect to connect to that data source, or Close to connect the dialog 
without connecting. You can reopen the dialog and modify the configuration 
or connect to the data source later.
<p>
<a name='queries' href='#top'>top</a>
<h4>RUNNINQ QUERIES</h4>

Once a connection has been established, you can query individual tables of 
the database. Use the following steps:

<ol>
<li>From the Connect menu, select Query Form...

</li><li>In the table selector dialog that appears, you may select the data 
source from the top list, which will show the ones you're currently 
connected to. Then, select the schema or the owner of the table you wish 
to query from the second list. Then, you can select the table from the 
third list. <strong>NOTE: </strong>If your datbase contains views as well as tables, the views
will be included in the table list. They will be listed, however, below all of
the tables in the list and their names will appear in italics.

</li><li>After you've selected a table, click OK to close the dialog. A new 
internal frame showing a Form View and a Grid View tab will appear. To 
enter query parameters in the form, select Form Query from the Action 
menu. This will make the form editable. 

</li><li>Once the form has been opened for editing, enter search criteria in the 
fields you want to query on. For example, entering Mary in a field labeled 
"FIRST_NAME" will return all records where the FIRST_NAME field is "Mary". 
You may also enter '%' characters as wildcards, for example, M% would 
match Mary, Mike, Matt, Mavis, etc. The matching may or may not be 
case-sensitive, depending on the database you're connected to. The 
comparison operators '<' and '>' can be used in numeric fields, for 
example, entering "> 100" in a numeric field will return all records with
a value greater than 100 in that field. An SQL "BETWEEN" clause can also
be entered in a numeric field, for example, "BETWEEN 100 AND 200".

</li><li>You may browse query results in the form, or switch to the grid view to 
view them in a table. To select which columns will be visible in the grid 
view, right-click on the Grid View tab and choose "Select Columns..." from 
the popup menu. In the dialog that appears, hold the control key and click 
column names to select or deselect them. To export a resultset to a file, 
right-click on either tab of the query frame and select one of the export 
options.
</li></ol>
<p>
<a name='metadata' href='#top'>top</a>
<h4>VIEWING TABLE METADATA</h4>

To view table metadata, after you've connected to a database, select Table 
Metadata from the Connect menu. Select a table as you would to open a new 
query window. This will bring up a window listing all of the columns for 
the selected table, along with their data types, null/non-null attributes, 
etc. For some databases, a separate tab will show the foreign keys for the 
table as well.
<p>
<a name='plaf' href='#top'>top</a>
<h4>PLUGGABLE LOOK-AND-FEELS</h4>

A "pluggable look-and-feel" is an add-on module that can change 
the appearance of certain visual features of an application, such as 
fonts, buttons, icons, colors, borders, etc., without changing the
application's code. QueryForm fully supports pluggable look-and-feels, and 
allows its look-and-feel to be changed while the program is running.
<p>
The Java runtime environment comes bundled with several look-and-feels, 
in addition to the default "Metal" look-and-feel. These will be available 
in the "Look and Feel"	submenu (available through the Window menu) when 
QueryForm is started. 
<p>
In addition to Java's bundled look-and-feels, a number of third-party 
look-and-feels, many of them free and open-source, are available. A 
partial list of available ones is at <a href='http://www.javootoo.com' target='_blank'>http://www.javootoo.com</a>.
<p>
A third-party look-and-feel usually comes packaged in a jar file, and 
often the jar file may be contained inside a zip file. To use a
third-party look-and-feel, the jar file must be placed into QueryForm's 
"drivers" directory (see the description of the drivers directory above) 
or it must be in QueryForm's classpath.
<p>
Each third-party look-and-feel has a main "class name" associated with it, 
and to use that look-and-feel, you must know the class name. This should 
be available from the look-and-feel's documentation. Unfortunately, most 
look-and-feel documentation is targeted toward Java developers, so it may 
take some digging to determine the main class name. One example is the 
Oyoaha look-and-feel, which is freely available at 
<a href='http://www.oyoaha.com/lookandfeel' target='_blank'>http://www.oyoaha.com/lookandfeel</a>. Its main class name is:
<p><pre>
    com.oyoaha.swing.plaf.oyoaha.OyoahaLookAndFeel
</pre><p>	
The main class name for other look-and-feels will probably be structured 
similarly to Oyoaha's, and often they end in "LookAndFeel".
<p>
After you have placed a third-party look-and-feel's jar file into 
QueryForm's drivers directory or classpath, restart QueryForm. From 
the Window menu, select the "Look and Feel" submenu, and then 
the "Install new..." menu item. This will bring up a dialog box, into 
which you should enter the look-and-feel's main class name. When you close 
the dialog box, QueryForm will automatically switch its look-and-feel to 
the one you have just installed, and it will be available in the "Look and 
Feel" menu, even after QueryForm has been restarted.
<p>
<strong>ADVANCED USERS:</strong> By default, QueryForm will always start up with the 
default Metal look-and-feel. To use another look-and-feel at startup, edit 
the script, batch file or shortcut that you are using to start QueryForm, 
and add this system property to the command line, right after "java":
<p><pre>
    -Dqform.laf=&lt;main class name of look-and-feel&gt;
</pre><p>	
<strong>CAUTION:</strong> Third-party look-and-feels are of varying quality. Some are 
better behaved than others. Some of the less-well-behaved ones may modify 
QueryForm's appearance in a way that, when a new look-and-feel is 
selected from the menu, features of the old one will remain. (This can be 
remedied by restarting the program, however, and the effect is purely 
cosmetic rather than functional.) To be fair to the authors of these 
look-and-feels, however, it should be noted that most look-and-feels are 
designed with the intent that they will not be changed "on-the-fly" while 
a program is running, but rather act as a program's hardcoded 
look-and-feel. Some of the better-behaved ones I've encountered are 
Oyoaha, mentioned above, and several from JGoodies, available at:
<p>
    <a target='_blank' href='http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/looks/index.html'>http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/looks/index.html</a>
<p>	
Please understand that I will not be able to provide support for 
third-party look-and-feels.	
<p>
<strong>NOTE: MANY THIRD-PARTY LOOK-AND-FEELS REQUIRE JAVA 1.4 OR LATER TO WORK 
PROPERLY.</strong>
