QueryForm Database Tool
Copyright 1998 - 2004 David F. Glasser

Several third-party libraries are required to compile and run
this program. The jar files for these libraries are not stored
in the CVS repository. Instead, they can be downloaded from their
respective providers or from the QueryForm homepage at
http://qform.sourceforge.net. If you install the QueryForm application 
with the automated Windows installation program 
(qform-N.NN-installer.jar), the required libraries will be installed 
along with the application.

The following jar files, which are part of the Apache Jakarta Commons
project (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons) are required:

commons-collections.jar
commons-dbcp.jar
commons-pool.jar

The following jar files, which are part of the Apache XML project
(http://xml.apache.org) are required:

crimson.jar
xalan.jar

Crimson.jar and xalan.jar provide XML parsers and transformers, 
respectively, and are called through Java's JAXP API. Advanced
users may want to configure their Java runtime environment to
use different libraries for these purposes.

If you are running a version of Java prior to version 1.4 (QueryForm
requires Java 1.3 or better), then you'll need to have these jar files,
which are available from http://java.sun.com, in your classpath:

jaxp-api.jar*
dom.jar* 
sax.jar*  
jdbc2_0-stdext.jar

*These jars are bundled in the Java Web Services Developer Pack.
