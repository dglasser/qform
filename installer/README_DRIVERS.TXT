If QueryForm was installed from the installation program, a directory:

    $INSTALL_PATH\drivers

should have been created below the directory where the
file qform.jar (which contains the application classes) is located. If
the directory does not exist, you can create it yourself. Any JAR or ZIP
files containing JDBC drivers can be placed into the drivers directory, 
and they will be available within the QueryForm program the next time
it is started.
